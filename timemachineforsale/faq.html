        style="font-family: arial;">
                   <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>
                   No, we strive to make the worst Time Machine Replicas for 8x the price of something better.<br>
            </span></span><span

            Q:
            How much does a Delorean Time Machine cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The average price of a Delorean conversion is around $10k to $20k, but unfortunately I need to increase my stock of red suspenders, so my prices are around $100k for conversions, $150k if no car is included</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
          <br style="font-family: arial; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
          <span
 style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
            How much does a plain Delorean cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>
            If you buy from us, you can have a fully functional car that definitely doesn't have parts stripped out of it and replaced with resin copies for $49,999.95. However, used Deloreans commonly come up for sale on shady websites from shady people, so if you'd prefer to buy from someone who isn't reliable and trustworthy like myself, be my guest.<br>
   <br style="font-family: arial;">
            </span><br style="font-family: arial;">
            <span
 style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
            How much is the cost of the conversion to a "Time Machine"?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The fee to turn your Delorean into a "Time Machine" starts at $75,000 and your dignity.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
          <br style="font-family: arial;">
          <span
 style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
            How long does it take to convert a Delorean into a "Time Machine".</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>
            We have completed cars for rush jobs in as little as 14 days.<br>
    
            <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you build these cars so quickly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The reason we can assemble these cars so fast is because we pre-fabricate our parts so quick that we don't even check their quality and we store them in an old abandoned warehouse so we're always ready for the next DeLorean ruination. There is no one else on Earth who can build one of these cars as quickly as we can without beating our build quality. We are very experienced in rushing the job so we have more time to count our money. Our templates, jigs, molds and schematics are cheap stuff as well and we don't give a fuck about screen accuracy.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Are
              converted Delorean Time Machines legal to drive on the street?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>NO!, the car is very likely to fall apart while you are driving it.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              any of the parts come off while driving the car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>YES! All of the parts are mounted with with the cheapest glue we could find.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              Universal Studios sue me for owning this car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Most likely.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Do you
              make RIGHT HAND conversions?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>No, but, we do offer Wrong Hand conversions.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              you ship anywhere?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Yes, and for a really fair price since we only use cheapest and most careless shipping methods.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
              Automatic or Stick Shift?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The original cars had Stick Shifts, but don't worry, if you provide us with an automatic car, we'll convert it anyway and won't try and disguise it as a manual. That way everyone will be able to tell you're a little bitch who can't drive stick!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Is the
              conversion permanent?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Depends on how long you have the car and how much action it sees. After some time parts may break, snap, or fall off completely if messed with. But the damage to the stock panels and parts will always be there<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Can I
              still get parts and maintenance for the Delorean?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>A company in Texas bought the DMC branding and provides replacements parts at services at a price that makes my prices look like a good deal. In other words; if you have money (which you clearly do since you're considering buying from me), then yes<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you get all the information to build these replicas so exactly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>I use the same few bits of information discovered by Gary Weaver in 2008 and build my cars to those standards. New information has come out since then but most BTTF fans are impressed by the dumbest things and won't care so long as the car has the big important features.<br>
            
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: If you
              replace the rear window with aluminum, will it leak?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Replacing the window with the aluminum bulkhead will not leak. This is completely different to the movie cars. Their bulkheads were designed completely differently and thus our cars do not have the slightest bit of accuracy in that regard. But hey, it won't leak! The roof still will though. That's just a stock delorean problem and until we can figure out a way to cast the entire car in resin there's not much we can do to fix that<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What
              types of options do you offer?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Our most common and easiest conversion is the Mr Fusion car, since most of the details of the nuclear reactor are covered up and we don't have to do them. However, if you prefer the nuclear reactor, don't worry, we still won't include most of those details. You can rest assured knowing that whatever option you pick will have the least amount of effort put into it and most amount of missing parts on it as we can!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              I know I can trust you with my money?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Don't you see how big our shop is and how rich we are? <br><br>Doesn't that mean we make good use of your money?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Okay,
              I'm ready to be bankrupt! How do we get started?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Just give me a call and we will arrange it shortly.</span>
