                   <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>

            Q:
            How much does a Delorean Time Machine cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The average cost of a completed Delorean Time Machine
            replica costs about $125K - $150,000 or more when you factor in the cost of the Delorean
            car, the conversion to a "Time Machine", basic repairs and upgrades and
            shipping.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">

          <span

            How much does a plain Delorean cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>
            Unmodified Deloreans can cost as little as $40,000 for one in fair
            condition to $100,000 or more for one in mint condition. It's all about
            what you want out of your replica and how good you want it to be based
            on your budget.<br>

 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The fee to turn your Delorean into a "Time Machine" starts at $75,000 and your dignity.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
          <br style="font-family: arial;">
          <span
 style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
            How long does it take to convert a Delorean into a "Time Machine".</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>
            We have completed cars for rush jobs in a little as 14 days.<br>
    
            <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you build these cars so quickly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The reason we can assemble these cars so fast is because we pre-fabricate our parts so quick that we don't even check their quality and we store them in an old abandoned warehouse so we're always ready for the next DeLorean ruination. There is no one else on Earth who can build one of these cars as quickly as we can without beating our build quality. We are very experienced in rushing the job so we have more time to count our money. Our templates, jigs, molds and schematics are cheap stuff as well and we don't give a fuck about screen accuracy.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Are
              converted Delorean Time Machines legal to drive on the street?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Not in a million years, the car is very likely to fall apart while you are driving it.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              any of the parts come off while driving the car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>YES! All of the parts are mounted with with the cheapest glue we could find.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              Universal Studios sue me for owning this car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Most likely.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Do you
              make RIGHT HAND conversions?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>No, but, we do offer Wrong Hand conversions.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              you ship anywhere?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Yes, and for a really fair price since we only use cheapest and most careless shipping methods.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
              Automatic or Stick Shift?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Deloreans come in
              both automatic transmissions and 5-speed manual transmissions.<br>
            The original screen used cars were manual, however we do a neat visual
            conversion to the automatic<br>
            shifter to make it look like it is a manual, so no one knows the
            difference! <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What
              engine is in the Delorean?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The Delorean has an
              aluminum V-6 made by Renault, Peugeot and Volvo called the PRV-6.<br>
            It uses a mechanical Bosche fuel injection system, once properly tuned,
            they run great!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Is the
              conversion permanent?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Depends on how long you have the car and how much action it sees. After some time parts may break, snap, or fall off completely if messed with. But the damage to the stock panels and parts will always be there<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Can I
              still get parts and maintenance for the Delorean?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>YES! You can get
              almost every part you could ever need for the car from many Delorean
              parts<br>
            dealers all over the world. When the company shut down pre-maturely in
            1982 there were lots of <br>
            parts left over and others have been reproduced, others are
            interchangeable with other vehicles.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you get all the information to build these replicas so exactly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>I use the same few bits of information discovered by Gary Weaver in 2008 and build my cars to those standards. New information has come out since then but most BTTF fans are impressed by the dumbest things and won't care so long as the car has the big important features.<br>
            
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: If you
              replace the rear window with aluminum, will it leak?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Replacing the window with the aluminum bulkhead will not leak. This is completely different to the movie cars. Their bulkheads were designed completely differently and thus our cars do not have the slightest bit of accuracy in that regard. But hey, it won't leak! The roof still will though. That's just a stock delorean problem and until we can figure out a way to cast the entire car in resin there's not much we can do to fix that<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What
              types of options do you offer?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>We can add exterior
              lighting on the bands, a remote controlled fog machine, <br>
            sound effects, engine and mechanical upgrades and more!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              I know I can trust you with my money?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Don't you see how big our shop is and how rich we are? <br><br>Doesn't that mean we make good use of your money?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Okay,
              I'm ready to change my future! How do we get started?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Just give me an email
              or a call and we can work on the details of sending the deposit and
              getting<br>
            the build underway.</span>
