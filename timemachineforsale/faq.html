            Q:
            How much does a Delorean Time Machine cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The average cost of a completed Delorean Time Machine
            replica costs about $125K - $150,000 or more when you factor in the cost of the Delorean
            car, the conversion to a "Time Machine", basic repairs and upgrades and
            shipping.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">

            How much does a plain Delorean cost?</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>
            Unmodified Deloreans can cost as little as $40,000 for one in fair
            condition to $100,000 or more for one in mint condition. It's all about
            what you want out of your replica and how good you want it to be based
            on your budget.<br>

 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>The fee to turn your Delorean into a "Time Machine" starts at $75,000 and your dignity.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">

            How long does it take to convert a Delorean into a "Time Machine".</span><br
 style="font-family: arial;">
            <span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:
            </span>
            We have completed cars for rush jobs in a little as 14 days.<br>
    
            <br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you build these cars so quickly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The reason we can
              assemble these cars so fast is because on our spare time we
              pre-fabricate<br>
            as many of the standard props as we can and store them on the shelf to
            get ready for the next build.<br>
            There is no one else on Earth who can build one of these cars as
            quickly as we can while maintaining<br>
            our build quality. We have more experience building these cars than
            anyone else.<br>
            We have templates, jigs, molds and schematics that allow us to maintain
            a consistency that is as<br>
            close to screen accurate as possible.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Are
              converted Delorean Time Machines legal to drive on the street?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Not in a million years, the car is very likely to fall apart while you are driving it.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              any of the parts come off while driving the car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>YES! All of the parts are mounted with with the cheapest glue we could find.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              Universal Studios sue me for owning this car?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Most likely.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Do you
              make RIGHT HAND conversions?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>No, sorry. This is
              not an option.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Will
              you ship anywhere?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Yes, and for a really fair price since we only use cheapest and most careless shipping methods.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q:
              Automatic or Stick Shift?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Deloreans come in
              both automatic transmissions and 5-speed manual transmissions.<br>
            The original screen used cars were manual, however we do a neat visual
            conversion to the automatic<br>
            shifter to make it look like it is a manual, so no one knows the
            difference! <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What
              engine is in the Delorean?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>The Delorean has an
              aluminum V-6 made by Renault, Peugeot and Volvo called the PRV-6.<br>
            It uses a mechanical Bosche fuel injection system, once properly tuned,
            they run great!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Is the
              conversion permanent?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>Yes, the conversion
              to a Time Machine is permanent and can not be undone easily.<br>
            We will be drilling holes and attaching parts to almost every panel on
            the car.<br>
            Don't worry though, your Delorean will be tripled in value!<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: Can I
              still get parts and maintenance for the Delorean?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>YES! You can get
              almost every part you could ever need for the car from many Delorean
              parts<br>
            dealers all over the world. When the company shut down pre-maturely in
            1982 there were lots of <br>
            parts left over and others have been reproduced, others are
            interchangeable with other vehicles.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: How do
              you get all the information to build these replicas so exactly?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: I </span>started my quest to
              do this project in 2004. I made multiple trips to Universal Studios
              Hollywood<br>
            to visit the real screen used Delorean Time Machine. I used my
            connections in the entertainment <br>
            industry to gain access to the car where I obtained detailed photos and
            measurements of every part<br>
            of the car. I also developed a professional relationship with KEVIN
            PIKE
            who was the special effects <br>
            supervisor that built the cars for the films who helped me with
            information and build techniques.<br>
            I worked with peers and fans to gather information, parts sources and
            schematics so that we could build<br>
            exacting replicas of the Time Machine.<br>
            Later in 2012 this group restored the "hero A car" for display at
              Universal Studios.<br>
            For my contributions in the project by sharing research information and
            parts I was included in the <br>
            dedication plaque mounted by the car as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Robert Moseley".</span><br>
            Since 2004, as of this writing, we have built 35 of these replica Time
            Machines.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What
              does the average conversion include?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span><br>

            * Spectrum Analyzer display <br>

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: If you
              replace the rear window with aluminum, will it leak?</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A: </span>We have a system of
              mounting the aluminum with a rubber gasket with silicone sealant<br>
            that seals the window from rain, wind and noise. It is safe to wash the
            car with water.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Q: What

              lighting on the bands, a remote controlled fog machine, <br>
            sound effects, engine and mechanical upgrades and more!<br>
            <br>

              I know I can trust you with my money?</span><br>
